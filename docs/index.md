Overview
--------

Serps is a set of tools that make it easy to parse **popular search engines** and to create reports.
It helps to parse **SERP** (Search Engine Result Page) and gives you a standard output of what is parsed.

The problem
-----------

Most of times search engines don't want you to parse them, and they don't offer a documentation or a standard way 
to extract the results from the SERP.

We tried to solve this problems by **analysing** how search engines behave and we give you the necessary tools to
work with them, from the URL generation to the parsing of the results. 
At the endpoint we give you a **standard and documented API**.

**TODO** We place additional efforts on monitoring them to make sure that our tools are always up to date.

Getting Started
---------------

Looking forward to work with the library? 

- Read our [getting started](getting-started.md).
- Check the [available search engines](search-engines.md).
- Get information about [proxies](proxies.md) and [http client implementations](http-clients.md).
- Work with [captcha services](captcha.md).
