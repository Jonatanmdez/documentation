What is it?
-----------

Serps is a set of tools that ease the parsing of **popular search engines**.
It helps to parse **SERP** (Search Engine Result Page) and gives you a standard output of what is parsed.

The problem
-----------

Most of times search engines don't want you to parse them, and they don't offer a documentation or a standard way 
to extract the results from the SERP.

The solution
------------

We tried to solve this problems by **analysing** how search engines behave and we built the necessary tools to
work with them, from the URL generation to the parsing of the results. 
At the endpoint we offer a **standard and documented API**.

**TODO** We place additional efforts on monitoring them to make sure that our tools are always up to date.
